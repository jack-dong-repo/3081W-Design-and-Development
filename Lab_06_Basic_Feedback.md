Link to full feedback: [Lab_06_Feedback.md](Lab_06_Feedback.md)



 __Below are the mutants that your tests will need to find for the Feedback__:


 * __Mutant:__ Dates constructed with epoch are about 70 years in the future


 * __Mutant:__ Days between calculation seems to be much larger than it should be.


 * __Mutant:__ Dates from GetDate are missing a character


 * __Mutant:__ Todays date month off by one


 * __Mutant:__ 1/1/2016 to 3/1/2016 is 60 days, but this version returns 59


 * __Mutant:__ Dates from GetUsDate are not in the right format (same as GetDate?)


 * __Mutant:__ operator-: Probably a copy paste error


 * __Mutant:__ Developer thought months should be zero-indexed


 * __Mutant:__ Some dates dont have leading zeroes
